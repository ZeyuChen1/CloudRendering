# About
This is the repository for my CPSC 591 term project. This project requires the newest macOS SDK (12.3). Some Xcode project settings regarding code signing
might need tweaking in order to build it successfully.

# Files
All source files are located in `CloudRendering/`. Rendering related files including shaders are in `CloudRendering/Render`, the rest of the source files
are for setting up a window to display the framebuffer.
